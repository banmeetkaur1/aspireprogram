To become a master of this area, you need to take courses that explore the craft of writing, such as "Line by Line" or "The Art of the Essay." You'll learn about the different genres and forms of writing, from poetry to fiction to nonfiction. And you'll discover how to use language in creative ways to express yourself.

But that's not all - there are two other areas that can help you become a better writer. The second area is called "Area 2: Digital Rhetoric." This area focuses on the intersection of writing and technology, including digital tools like websites, social media, and email. It's like being a hacker trying to crack the code of online communication.

To master this area, you'll need to take courses that explore the digital side of writing, such as "Digital Research and Writing" or "Digital Compositions." You'll learn how to use technology to create and disseminate your ideas, and how to navigate the complex world of online communication.
